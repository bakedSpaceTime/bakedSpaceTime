### Hey there, welcome to my namespace ðŸ‘‹

I am Tushya from beautiful Raincouver(Vancouver), British Columbia ðŸŒ§

Currently persuing a Computer System from BCIT

Fumbling my way through all things tech...

_Especially_ interested in Linux and open source at the moment. I am trying out new distributions on my second computer and I am starting to dip my toes into NixOS

Working in carbon capture so I can help empower crazy scientists and engineers to save our planet
